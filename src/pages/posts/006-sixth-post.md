Ready in 30 minutes, this vegan hibachi-style fried rice makes for a great midweek meal. Day-old rice works best, so plan ahead!

2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 brown onion, cut into wedges

425g can baby corn, drained, halved lengthways
5 cups cold cooked medium-grain rice (see notes)
2 cups chopped Chinese cabbage
100g frozen edamame, thawed, podded
1/4 cup drained pickled ginger
10g packet sea salt seaweed snack, crushed
2 green onions, thinly sliced diagonally

Instructions:-

Step 1
Whisk miso paste, sake, tonkatsu sauce, sesame oil and 2 tablespoons water in a medium jug. Set aside.
Step 2
Heat a wok or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add peanut oil. Swirl to coat. Add brown onion, carrot, mushrooms and corn. Stir-fry for 5 minutes or until vegetables are lightly charred.
