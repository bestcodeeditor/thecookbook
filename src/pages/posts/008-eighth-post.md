Description:-

Begun bhaja transaltes into 'fried brinjal' and is a dish prepared out of thick slices of the eggplant marinated in spices and coated with rice flour and deep fried.

Tips to make best Begun Bhaja :-

Use the large variety of brinjal that we use to make Baingan Bharta.

Take a brinjal that has less seeds and is fresh.

Cut the brinjal into same size slices. It will make sure the slices are cooked evenly.

You can choose to skip coating the brinjal in rice flour and just fry directly.

Fry the brinjal in mustard oil to get the authentic flavour.

What to serve with Begun Bhaja?

Begun Bhaja and Khichdi is a perfect combination and is loved by all Bengalies.
