Garlic- 6 cloves
Green chilies- 2
Onion- 1 large/ 300gm, grated
Oil- half cup

Yogurt- 1/2 cup, whisked till smooth
Freshly ground garam masala powder- 1 heaped tsp
Sugar- 1/4 tsp
Cilantro- 1 Tbsp, chopped
Cream- 2 Tbsp

Procedure:
Immerse the cauliflower in a brine made of 3 cups of water and 1.5 tsp of salt. Allow the cauliflower to sit in this brine for 30 minutes. Remove it and allow it to dry.

Grind together the ginger , garlic and green chilies to make a fine paste.

Heat oil in a large, deep heavy bottom fry pan (or dutch oven, eg. Le Creuset ). Add the grated onions and fry it on a medium low flame till it turns golden brown.

Add the ginger garlic paste, tomato paste, turmeric, coriander powder, cumin powder, chilli powder, 1/4 cup water and salt to taste (approx. 2.5 tsp).

Add the yogurt , a table spoon at a time till all the yoghurt has been incorporated and the oil separates from the masala.

Mix in the heaped tsp of freshly ground garam masala and sugar.

Place the entire cauliflower and stir fry for about 8 minutes and end with the cauliflower stump facing up.

Place the fry pan with the cauliflower in a preheated 350 degree F oven. Lightly cover with an aluminum foil and bake for about 15 minutes.

After about 15 minutes raise the temperature of the oven to 400 degrees F, remove the foil and this time place the cauliflower stump facing down.

After about 20 minutes, check for doneness. The cauliflower should hold its shape and not be mushy.

Place the cauliflower on a platter and pour the masala over it. Garnish with cream and cilantro.
